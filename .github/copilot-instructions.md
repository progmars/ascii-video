# Instructions for Copilot
* We are using Powershell. Always use Powershell syntax: ; instead of &&, --- instead of -- etc.
* When you are choosing or installing libraries (or choosing libraries), always do a web search first to ensure you are using up-to-date libraries and install them correctly.
* Repeatedly build the project while adding new features
* Repeatedly analyse the project structure to find duplicated code and dead code
* When you cannot delete a file, or when you do not see any output, it is likely caused by the environment. Tell the user and ask him to fix it.

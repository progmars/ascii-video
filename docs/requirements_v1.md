# Product Requirements Document - ASCII Video Converter v1.0

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Product Name
ASCII Video Converter

### 1.2 Product Vision
A Progressive Web Application (PWA) that transforms standard MP4 videos into ASCII art animations, providing users with a unique and artistic way to view video content through text-based representations.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- Digital artists and creative professionals
- Developers and tech enthusiasts
- Social media content creators
- Anyone interested in retro/ASCII art aesthetics

### 1.4 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **PWA**: Service Worker with offline capabilities
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Video Upload (FR-001)
**Description**: Users can upload MP4 video files for conversion to ASCII format.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User can select and upload MP4 video files via file input or drag-and-drop interface
- System validates file format (MP4 only)
- System validates file size (maximum 10MB)
- System displays upload and conversion progress indicator
- System shows error messages for invalid files or oversized uploads
- System provides clear feedback when upload is successful

**Priority**: High

### 2.2 ASCII Video Conversion (FR-002)
**Description**: The application converts uploaded MP4 videos into ASCII art representations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System extracts frames from the uploaded video
- System maps pixel brightness to ASCII characters (e.g., ' ', '.', ':', ';', '=', '+', '*', '#', '@')
- System also keeps track of colors, averaging out the color of the pixels represented by a character
- System maintains video timing/frame rate for playback
- System provides conversion progress indicator
- System allows users to cancel conversion process
- Conversion quality is adjustable (higher character density for higher resolution)

**Priority**: High

### 2.3 ASCII Video Playback (FR-003)
**Description**: Users can play the converted ASCII video with standard video controls.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System displays ASCII video in a monospace font container
- System scales the ASCII output so that the video frames fit the container
- User can play, pause, and stop the ASCII video
- User can seek to different positions in the video
- System displays current playback time and total duration
- System provides volume control (if original video has audio)
- Playback maintains original video frame rate
- User can toggle fullscreen mode for ASCII video

**Priority**: High

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance (NFR-001)

- Application should be responsive and work on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Error messages should be clear and actionable

### 3.3 Compatibility (NFR-003)
- Support modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- Work offline as a PWA after initial load
- Support touch gestures on mobile devices

### 3.4 Security (NFR-004)
- All file processing happens client-side (no server uploads)
- No user data is stored or transmitted to external servers
- Content Security Policy (CSP) implemented
- HTTPS required for PWA functionality

## 4. User Interface Requirements

### 4.1 Upload Interface (UI-001)
- Clean, minimalist design with clear upload area
- Drag-and-drop zone with visual feedback
- File selection button as alternative to drag-and-drop
- Progress bar during upload and validation
- File information display (name, size, duration)

### 4.2 Conversion Interface (UI-002)
- Progress indicator showing conversion status
- Preview of current frame being processed
- Conversion settings panel (resolution, character set)
- Cancel button to stop conversion

### 4.3 Playback Interface (UI-003)
- ASCII video display area with monospace font
- Standard video controls (play, pause, seek, volume)
- Fullscreen toggle button
- Time display (current/total)

### 4.4 Responsive Design (UI-004)
- Mobile-first approach with touch-friendly controls
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes
- Consistent styling using Tailwind CSS v4
- Dark/light theme support

## 5. Technical Specifications

### 5.1 Video Processing
- **Input Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec preferred)
- **Maximum File Size**: 10MB
- **Frame Extraction**: Using Canvas API and Video element
- **ASCII Character Set**: Configurable density levels

### 5.2 PWA Features
- **Service Worker**: Cache application files for offline use
- **Manifest**: Enable "Add to Home Screen" functionality
- **Icons**: Progressive enhancement with app icons
- **Offline Mode**: Allow playback of previously converted videos

### 5.3 Browser APIs Used
- **File API**: For video upload handling
- **Canvas API**: For frame extraction and processing
- **Web Workers**: For non-blocking video conversion
